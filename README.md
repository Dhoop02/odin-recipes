This will be a project to showcase some of what I have learned so far.
One of my biggest struggles but biggest conquests was figuring out the connection to github
This project will showcase what I have learned in HTML thus far and will be shown here in github

Project consists of 4 pages linked together, each contatins a uniform format and can navigate to each other.
Made attempts to try and keep items centered, need to learn more about uniformity so it looks cleaner
Overall not a bad first attempt at making a simple product.
